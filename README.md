# Simple Recipes

This project was created as part of my school lessons.

It is a simple React app that displays a collection of recipes, including several Swedish dishes. The main page shows a grid of recipe cards with images, and each recipe has its own detailed page. All measurements are in metric units.

## Features
- Responsive recipe grid with images
- Dynamic pages for each recipe
- Clean, mobile-friendly design

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.
